In this workshop your goal will be to animate this web page.

1. Listen an event on the button.
2. Change the background color of the page when the event is triggered according to the css variables already declared.
3. You have to change the name displayed of the button according to the action we will trigger when we will click on it (`Day` or `Night`).
